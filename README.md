# Fred
Fred is an open-source AI project focused on logic, reasoning, and domain-specific intelligence.
Built from the ground up, Fred is starting with a custom-trained GPT model fine-tuned on problem-solving tasks in hacking, engineering, and abstract reasoning.
The long-term goal: match and eventually surpass models like GPT-4o in logic-based benchmarks like ARC and BBH — through efficient training, RLHF, and automation.
This is a work in progress.
Fred doesn’t aim to be everything. Just the smartest in the room.
